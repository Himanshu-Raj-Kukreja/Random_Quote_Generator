# Random_Quote_Generator
This project is a fun little Random Quote Generator. When you open it, you see a daily quote along with the authorâ€™s name. Just click on the button to fetch a new quote from the internet, and it updates the quote and author for you. The design is simple and modern, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a neat layout and smooth transitions.
